      <h3>What I want in life?</h3>
      <p>Answering this question is hard. <br> I want a simple and happy life. I need to earn some money to pay my bills and to fulfil my small desires. That's it. If I take care of this money part alone, my need is over (hmm... may be for just
        now?). I have lovely people around me (my love and my family). And that is all I wanted.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Earn some money to make my life easier.</li>
        <li>Being with my family.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I already have the second part. I just want to make some money.</p>

      <p>But, this is not the case. As the time and situation changes 'what I want?' also changes. Sometimes situation around me may demand more. I'm not talking about someone's influence on me. Sometimes it is a requirement for me to do more just
        for the survival (medical expenses, debt etc).</p>

      <p>I should be able to differentiate from the two:<br>
        <p><strong>1. What I want?</strong></p>
        Answer for this question did not come just like that. It is an evolving process. My desires was changing time to time. I think this is an endless evolving process. Take this two steps:<br>
        <p>Step 1: Right now what I want in my life?<br>
        Step 2: Make it happen.</p>
        <p><strong>2. What the situation wants from me?</strong></p>
        Ask a sub question. 'Is there a way to escape or avoid this situation?'<br>
        If yes, avoid it.<br>
        If no, make it happen.
